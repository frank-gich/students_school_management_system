The provided code seems to be a part of a Django web application for managing student-related tasks such as viewing attendance, applying for leave, giving feedback, viewing results, etc. Here's a brief overview of the functions:

1. **student_home**: Retrieves various data related to a student's attendance, courses, subjects, and online classrooms.
2. **join_class_room**: Allows a student to join an online classroom session.
3. **student_view_attendance**: Renders the template for a student to view their attendance.
4. **student_view_attendance_post**: Retrieves attendance data based on the selected subject and date range.
5. **student_apply_leave**: Renders the template for a student to apply for leave.
6. **student_apply_leave_save**: Saves the leave application submitted by the student.
7. **student_feedback**: Renders the template for a student to give feedback.
8. **student_feedback_save**: Saves the feedback submitted by the student.
9. **student_profile**: Renders the template for viewing and editing student profile information.
10. **student_profile_save**: Saves changes made to the student's profile.
11. **student_fcmtoken_save**: Saves the FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) token for sending notifications.
12. **student_all_notification**: Renders the template for viewing all notifications for the student.
13. **student_view_result**: Renders the template for viewing the student's results.

Each function serves a specific purpose within the student management system, interacting with models and rendering appropriate templates to provide the desired functionality to the users.

Email Availability Check:

When the user types in the email input field (#id_email), an AJAX request is triggered.
The AJAX request sends the entered email to the server to check its availability.
Upon receiving the response from the server:
If the response is "True" (indicating that the email is not available), it dynamically adds a red error message indicating that the email is not available.
If the response is anything else (indicating that the email is available), it dynamically adds a green message indicating that the email is available.
If the email input field is cleared, any existing error messages are removed.
Username Availability Check:

Similar to the email availability check, this part of the code performs an AJAX request to check the availability of the username field (#id_username) as the user types.
The AJAX request sends the entered username to the server to check its availability.
Upon receiving the response from the server:
If the response is "True" (indicating that the username is not available), it dynamically adds a red error message indicating that the username is not available.
If the response is anything else (indicating that the username is available), it dynamically adds a green message indicating that the username is available.
If the username input field is cleared, any existing error messages are removed.
This JavaScript code is enclosed within a {% block custom_js %} and {% endblock custom_js %} to be included in a Django template where customization of JavaScript is needed. Ensure that jQuery is included in your template or base template for this script to work since it uses jQuery functions like $(document).ready() and $.ajax().
